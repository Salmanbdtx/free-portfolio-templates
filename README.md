# Portfolio Templates

A collection of three beautifully designed portfolio templates built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. Each template presents the same portfolio content (hero, skills, projects, about, and contact) in a unique visual style, demonstrating how design choices can dramatically transform the presentation without changing the underlying content.

## Purpose

This repository provides three ready-to-use portfolio templates that you can customize for your own projects. Perfect for developers, designers, and creatives who want to showcase their work with different aesthetic approaches.

## Templates

### Template 1: Minimal & Clean

Elegant, spacious, and organized - perfect for a professional first impression.
